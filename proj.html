        <p><b>Decentralized Spectrum Sensing </b><br/>
            An asynchronous federated learning framework for large spatial-temporal scale spectrum sensing, using Android devices and SDR FPGA boards. Leverage federated learning to solve the problem of user privacy and sharing scheme. Integrate blockchain to boost system robustness and in the meantime empower fair reward scheme. <br/>

        <p><b>Rocket-Chip FPGA Transplant </b><br/>
            Implemented a verilog wrapper for Rocket-Chip project as well as a linux boot flow on Digilent Nexys4DDR. The project provides the research community with a fresh platform with which any computer architects can easily boot linux and perform evaluation over a RISC-V core using a cheap FPGA board instead of pure simulators. 73★ 21⑂<br/>
